This page collects experience reports about problems with Go that might inform our design of solutions to those problems. These reports should focus on the _problems_: they should not focus on and need not propose solutions. To propose solutions, see the [proposal process](https://golang.org/s/proposal). 

We hope to use these experience reports to understand where people are having trouble writing Go, to help us prioritize future changes to the Go ecosystem.  (We do not promise to reply to these. If you need immediate help answering questions about Go, see [https://golang.org/help/](https://golang.org/help/) for resources.)

__The best experience reports tell: (1) what you wanted to do, (2) what you actually did, and (3) why that wasn’t great, illustrating those by real concrete examples, ideally from production use.__ Please write these reports about the problems most significant to you, post them on your own blog, or on Medium, or as a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/) (use a `.md` extension for Markdown), or as a publicly-readable Google doc, and then link them here. (Talk videos or slides are also welcome, although they are not as convenient for us to digest.)

If you do not have permission to edit the wiki to add an article to this list, [please file an issue](https://golang.org/issue/new).

Please keep the overall page sorted alphabetically by section (Error Handling before Logging, and so on).
Within a section, please keep articles sorted chronologically.
It's helpful to include a one-phrase summary of the point of each article.

Add new sections as appropriate.

- Jelte Fennema, "[Fixing the billion dollar mistake in Go by borrowing from Rust](https://getstream.io/blog/fixing-the-billion-dollar-mistake-in-go-by-borrowing-from-rust/)", June 14, 2018 - Nil pointer dereferences cause panics in production - it would be great if the type system would catch some of those.
- Mike Schinkel, "[On Typing Strings in Go _(More Constrained vs. Less Constrained)_](https://mikeschinkel.me/2019/on-typing-strings-in-go/), March 2019, Discusses how the benefits of creating types derived from basic types are often outweighed by the need to use constant type-casting in contexts where said type casting provides no extra type safety, i.e. when casting to a less-constrained otherwise-identical type.
- Mike Schinkel, "[Pros and cons of leveraging Go types](https://mikeschinkel.me/2019/pros-and-cons-of-leveraging-go-types/), April 2019, Discusses how great Go's type system is but tries to show how really using it can be extremely tedious and make for code that is harder-to-reason-about, so proposes an explicit `type alias` feature.
