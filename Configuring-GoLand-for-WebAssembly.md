# Configuring GoLand for WebAssembly (Wasm) projects

## Initial project configuration

When you first open or start a WebAssembly project in GoLand, it won't understand the "*syscall/js*" package.

That's easily fixable, by changing the **GOOS** and **GOARCH** values in the project settings, as per the screenshots below.

**Note** - The screenshot below shows how to access **Settings** on a Linux desktop.  If you're using macOS, you'll probably need to access them through the standard macOS **Preferences** option.

## Configuring Run/Debug settings

With the initial project settings changed, you'll probably want to configure the Run/Debug settings next.

That will let you recompile the .wasm file by just launching `Run` (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd> on Linux.md).

Finished, your GoLand setup should now be complete.
