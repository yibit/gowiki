This document collects thoughts and notes about versioned Go modules from the Gophers [#vgo](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/vgo.md) channel. Invites to Gophers Slack from [here](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/).

### Initial paper

The **initial paper** can be read here [https://research.swtch.com/vgo](https://research.swtch.com/vgo.md).

The **proposal** can be found here [https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24301](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24301).

The **reference implementation**: [https://go.googlesource.com/vgo/](https://go.googlesource.com/vgo/) and mirrored on Github here: [https://github.com/golang/vgo](https://github.com/golang/vgo.md).

The **[Go issue tracker](https://golang.org/issues)** is used to track bugs/feature requests. Issues should have the label `modules` and titles starting with `cmd/go` so that they can be automatically categorized. You can read the [existing issues here](https://golang.org/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label:modules).

**Note**: The reference implementation was named `vgo`, but support for modules is being integrated into the `go` command itself. The feature within the `go` command is called “versioned Go modules” (or “[[modules]]” for short), not “vgo”.

***

### Current state

Currently, module support is in active development in the main `go` repository, with changes mirrored back to the `vgo` repository. Module support still has some rough edges. You are encouraged to [[try it|Modules]] and give your feedback, share your experience with it, and contribute to it.

For any production workloads, use [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep), or migrate to it if you have not done so already.

The proposal has been accepted and vgo was merged into the Go tree in version 1.11.

You will be able to experiment with the module workflow from Go 1.11 as it is included as an experiment in this release.
